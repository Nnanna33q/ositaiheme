        <p>
          We all know he's one of the best Nigerian actors Nollywood produced. Osita
          Iheme (Born on 20th February 1982 in Imo State) is an actor, author and
          producer.<br />
          He is popularly known as <b>Pawpaw</b> in the film <b>Aki na Uwa</b>. Despite his
          small physique, his small body is filled with charisma. He brought many families<br>
          together in their living rooms and put a big smile on our faces in the early 2000s. 
          Looking back on those days gives me undeniable feeling of nostalgia.
          I am grateful for Osita Iheme's contributions to Nollywood and to the world. He is a talented actor, a kind 
          and compassionate person and a true inspiration. I wish him all the best in the years to come.
